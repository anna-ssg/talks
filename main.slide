## What does a static site generator do?

A Static Site Generator (SSG) merges templates with content files to produce static websites by converting markdown into static HTML files, resulting in fast and easy-to-maintain websites.

##  Genesis
The ACM student chapter at PESU ECC conducts an annual six-week **ACM Industrial Experience Program** where students work as a team to develop industrial-level projects. ([AIEP](https://acmpesuecc.github.io/aiep/anna)) gave us hands-on experience with real-world projects and is an excellent opportunity to interact with like-minded individuals.

Discussions over a week revealed how tiring it is to maintain blog sites, a task that becomes more cumbersome as content grows.
We decided to tackle this problem by developing our own SSG, in Go!

##  We began the project in a unique manner

Each of us creating our own prototype of the SSG. This was done to familiarize everyone with the Go toolchain.

The first version of the SSG did just **three** things.

- It rendered markdown (stored in files in a content folder in the project directory) to HTML. 
- This HTML was injected into a layout.html file and served over a local web server. 
- Later, we implemented a front matter YAML parser to retrieve page metadata

## What's in a name?

Probably the first thing that the four of us came across when joining ACM and HSP was the famous Saaru repository, another SSG built by one of our seniors. Saaru is a thin lentil soup, usually served with rices

This was just a playful stunt that we engaged in. We planned on beating Saaru at site render times, optimizing at runtime.

    In Kannada, rice is referred to as (‡≤Ö‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤®) pronounced: /…ênÀê…ê/


## Starting Point: CLI Development

Our journey began with developing a command-line interface (CLI) for our static site generator. We used the Cobra library to create a robust and user-friendly CLI. Cobra's features allowed us to easily define commands, flags, and commands, making our tool intuitive and efficient for users.

All the available flags and options can be viewed by entering *anna -h*

By leveraging Cobra, we provided a structured and organized interface, enabling users to interact with our static site generator seamlessly. This foundation set the stage for implementing additional features and optimizations.

## Profiling

The project's primary goal was to optimize performance. To achieve this, the first task undertaken was to implement a code profiling mechanism. This allowed the team to analyze the code's execution time and identify potential bottlenecks for further optimization.

The goal of the project was to optimize performance, and the team utilized the Pprof library as a one-stop solution for profiling and performance analysis. By implementing a code profiling mechanism using Pprof, the team was able to analyze the execution time of the code and identify potential bottlenecks for further optimization. This allowed them to focus on improving the performance of the static site generator and achieve faster rendering times. The Pprof library provided valuable insights into the code's execution, enabling the team to make informed decisions and optimize the performance of the project effectively.

## Basic implementation

.code -edit ./Profiling/main.go

## Directory Watchdog and Live Render

We implemented a directory watchdog system to streamline our workflow, avoiding the need to manually restart the program for code or content changes. This system monitors the working directory for modifications, automatically triggering a rerendering process and updating the output in real-time. Additionally, it serves the rendered content for easy previewing, allowing us to see changes immediately. This improvement has made our development process more efficient and seamless, enabling quick iterations without manual intervention.

## POC 

We implemented a live reload system using a liveReload struct to enhance our development workflow. The struct maintains an error logger, a map of file modification times, directories to monitor, file extensions to watch, a server status flag, and the site data path.

.code ./LiveReload/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

The system scans specified directories for changes in files with given extensions. When a change in fileTimes is detected, it triggers the LiveReload pipeline to rerender content and update the output. This ensures real-time previews without manual intervention, enhancing development efficiency.

## RSS / Atom feed
RSS and Atom feeds are standardized formats used for distributing and accessing updates from websites. They provide structured metadata such as titles, links, and publication dates, allowing users and applications to efficiently stay informed about new content without visiting each site individually

You get to read articles offline and cache posts for later use. You can follow websites made with anna inside Brave (a popular web browser), Thunderbird or newsboat like I do. 

Users can have blog sites of their own and do not have to worry about distribution or managing newsfeeds. Feeds in anna are turned on by default.

## A buffer is used to efficiently build the XML content before writing it to the file. 
This avoids multiple file writes, which is slower.

.code ./Feed/feed1.go

Adding XML declaration and initializing root <rss> elements in buffer.

.code ./Feed/feed2.go

## Filtering and sorting posts by publication date
We don't want draft posts to show up!

.code ./Feed/feed3.go

Your RSS reader should pick it up, but let's sort them to ensure they make semantic sense.

## Generating XML entries for the body
for each sorted post and writing to a file

.code ./Feed/feed4.go

## For Robots ü§ñ 
A sitemap tells web crawlers how your site is structured, outlining how often different pages are updated and helping search engines index your content efficiently.

.code ./Feed/robots.txt

.image ./Feed/seo.png

## A buffer is used similar to the atom feed

.code ./Feed/sitemap1.go

.code ./Feed/sitemap2.go

## For Humans üëæ
An important ease-of-use feature was building a GUI

The wizard lets a user pick a theme, enter your name, pick navbar elements, and validates fields using **regex** checks so you don‚Äôt need to worry about relative paths in baseURLs, canonical links, and sitemaps.

## Bootstrapping themes
A catalog of themes are up on our GitHub, with a json index. Anna pulls the latest ones, populates a list of themes you can pick with the wizard.

.code -edit ./BootstrapThemes/themes.go

## Asynchronous 
Signals are asynchronous processed using a channel (FormSubmittedCh)

.code -edit ./Wizard/wizard1.go

## After successfully completing the setup, the wizard launches a live preview of your site in a new tab

.code -edit ./Wizard/wizard2.go

This ensures robust error handling for various stages like JSON decoding, file writing, and theme downloading.

.code -edit ./deepdatamerge/main.go

## Parallel Rendering pipelines

To build a fast and efficient static site generator , we implemented parallel rendering using goroutines. Instead of rendering Markdown files iteratively, we utilized goroutines to process them concurrently.

By spawning a goroutine for each Markdown file, we significantly reduced the rendering time. This approach leverages Go's concurrency model, allowing multiple files to be rendered simultaneously, thus improving overall performance.

## Curent Parallel Rendering Pipeline Model 

.code ./ParaRender/main.go

## Future Optimizations Plans

To further enhance performance, future plans include:

*Fine-Tuning the Parallel Rendering Pipeline:*
- Refine our current parallel rendering process to achieve even better efficiency and speed.

*Switching to bufio:*
- Utilize bufio for more efficient buffered I/O operations, replacing regular I/O methods.

*Caching Frequently Used Files:*
- Implement caching for frequently accessed files, such as templates, to reduce load times.

## Future Optimizations Plans

*Worker Pool Implementation:*
- Introduce a worker pool to manage concurrent rendering tasks more effectively.

*File Read-Ahead:*
- Implement file read-ahead strategies to minimize idle time by preloading necessary data.

*Optimizing I/O Operations:*
- Streamline other I/O processes to reduce the number of syscalls, thereby improving overall performance.

## Benchmarking and Stress Testing

With all current optimizations and future plans in place, we recognized the need for a comprehensive benchmarking and stress testing strategy to evaluate our progress and compare it against competitors. This involves:

*Base Performance Metrics:*
- Measure key performance indicators (KPIs) such as render time, memory usage, and CPU utilization for our static site generator with the help of the profiling system already set up.

*Creating Benchmarking Scenarios:*
- Develop a variety of test cases, including different site sizes, complexity levels, and types of content, to assess performance under various conditions.

## Benchmarking and Stress Testing

*Stress Testing:*
- Conduct stress tests to push the system to its limits and identify bottlenecks by rendering thousands of Markdown content pages. This helps in understanding how the system performs under heavy load and what areas need improvement.

*Comparative Analysis:*
- Benchmark our static site generator against competitors, using the same test scenarios, to see where we stand and to identify areas for possible optimization.

*Continuous Monitoring and Feedback:*
- With the tools implemented so far, such as Live Render and Profiling, we can achieve continuous monitoring during the benchmarking process. These tools provide real-time feedback and detailed reports on performance metrics.
